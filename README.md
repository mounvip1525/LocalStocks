## What is Local Stocks? :thinking:
Local stocks aims to function as an effective and efficient bridge between Indian farmers and buyers across the world for high-quality organic produce without relying on the middlemen. An integrated approach is followed by us for delivering the best organic food for everyone. We provide a proper platform to all those farmers to reach out to the customers directly and not just as a simple E-commerce website but to connect the people of the urban population with the roots of nature.
